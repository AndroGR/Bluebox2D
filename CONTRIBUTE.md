# Contributing to Bluebox2D:

Contributors are always welcome in Bluebox2D. From the very beginning, the code was written in a way that would easily be read from another person for this purpose. But, before you commit your bug fix, please read this document.

[Code Of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\
[How To Contribute Correctly](#how-to-contribute-correctly)\

## Code of Conduct

When you contribute to Bluebox2D, you are expected to follow these rules:
- 1. Avoid using awful language / cursing. Please respect the other's feelings, even if you disagree with them. Don't call them things that may make them feel bad, or criticize them for anything.
- 2. Don't judge the way somebody works. Someone may write code in a not so stylish way. It is none of your business to tell them what to do. If the code is bad, it will not be merged with the rest of the source code.
- 3. Talk in a polite way. Even if the person you are replying to is your own brother, you should still respect him and talk to eachother in a polite way.
- 4. If your contribution is rejected, it's rejected. Don't try to explain why it should have been accepted. You get one chance to explain why your code should be merged.
- 5. Be welcoming to everybody. You should welcome everybody into the project and cooperate with them.
- 6. Respect the other 5 rules.

## How To Contribute

-It is recommended that each contribution you do only fixes or adds one feature. Eg if you fix a bug and add a new element available, then commit one at a time. If a new feature however requires something to be changed, please mention that in your commit.

-Note that all commits should be related directly to the project. Things like plugins will rarely get accepted.

-When contributing source code, make sure your code is readable enough, reuses existing code and explains everything with details. If any of these isn't satisfied, your code will be rejected.

-Avoid commits like "Fixed bugs" and "Remove deprecated code". It's confusing, unreadable and bad practice at once.

-If you do not know how to use Git from the command line, then GitHub will suit you fine. Fork the original repository, add your own source code in the fork, and make a pull request.

This is primarily for now all you need to know. If you have any questions, open an issue (Issues are accepted as they indicate something is missing).
