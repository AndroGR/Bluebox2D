# Contributing and license:

Both the license and how to contribute already exist in the root of source tree [(LICENSE](../../LICENSE) and [CONTRIBUTE.md)](../../CONTRIBUTE.md). You are adviced to read it the latter directly.

## License

Bluebox2D is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), version 3. This basically means that:

- You are allowed to do whatever you want with the project. That means you can decompile the binaries, do literally anything you want with the source code, fork it, sell it and make money off it, or anything else. More detailed description can be found [here.](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms)
- If you decide to publish whatever you did from the above, you must also license it under the GNU GPL. That is assuming that the source code you got was licensed under the GNU GPL too (run `bluebox license` to verify).
- Everything that you did should be public, unless it's for **PERSONAL** use. That is, if you decide to give a copy of Bluebox2D to a friend, you must tell them what did you change, and hand them a copy of the license too.
- You do not have to comply with the license, as long as you do not give any works (Binaries, source code or pretty much anything associated with Bluebox2D) to anyone else.

You can read the actual license either at [the official GNU website](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), the LICENSE file in the beginning of the source tree, or in `/usr/share/bluebox/LICENSE` (The latter only available after installation).
