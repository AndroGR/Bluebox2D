# Bluebox Developer Documentation

If you want to start developing for Bluebox2D, welcome ! This is the developer documentation for any future contributors.\
This file will introduce you into the actual documentation. In the same directory as this file, other Markdown files must exist, which contain the actual documentation. This approach is used so that we avoid clutter.

# Go To
[1. Contributing and license](contributing_and_license.md)\
[2. Coding Style and optimizing](coding_style.md)\
[3. Using the API](using_the_api.md)\
[4. Plugins](plugins.md)\
[5. Useful macros to use](useful_macros.md)\
[6. Mixing languages](mixing_languages.md)\
[7. Configuring at runtime](configuring.md)

Make sure to read as much of the documentation as possible. If you post something like "I didn't know this" while it is clearly stated in the documentation, you will not be taken seriously.
